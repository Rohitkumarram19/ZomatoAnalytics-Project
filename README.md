# ZomatoAnalytics-Project
Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis Project involved the examination of Zomato restaurant data using advanced Excel functions and SQL queries, alongside the development of interactive dashboards through Power BI and Tableau. Its objectives included:

Creating country and calendar tables with various attributes like year, month, quarter, etc.
Analyzing restaurant distribution by city and country.
Examining restaurant opening trends over time.
Categorizing restaurants based on average ratings and price ranges.
Evaluating the presence of table booking and online delivery options.
Visualizing data through charts based on cuisines, city, ratings, and other relevant parameters.
To fulfill these objectives, the project utilized advanced Excel functions such as VLOOKUP, PivotTables, and conditional formatting, alongside SQL queries to extract necessary data from the Zomato dataset. The obtained data was then employed to craft interactive dashboards using Power BI and Tableau, providing valuable insights into various aspects of the restaurant industry.

This project serves as a demonstration of how Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau can be leveraged for data analysis and visualization, making it a valuable resource for those interested in learning about these tools and techniques.
